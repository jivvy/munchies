# Munchies Mod for Minecraft

**Minecraft Version Support**: 1.20.1

## Overview

This is a tiny mod for Minecraft that does one thing: Change the speed you eat some foods.

By default, the config contains:

 - Apples and carrots eaten slightly faster
 - Beetroot eaten somewhat faster
 - Melon slices, sweet berries, glow berries, cookies eaten very fast

There is also an option in the config for automatically assigning food eating values based on how much nutrition they provide. Any specific food eat durations will be preferred over this.

## Compatability

This mod should work with almost any modded food items.
